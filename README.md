## About

The weather dashboard is an in-browser application that allows you to view the current and future weather for a city. When you search for a city in the search box, the current weather (condition, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index) will be displayed below the city's name.

A five-day forecast, showing the same characteristics, appears underneath. Each day is displayed seperately. Temperature is displayed in degrees farenheit and windspeed is displayed in miles per hour (MPH). The user can search for any city; however, if the city's name is spelled wrong, or a city without weather data is used, a 404 error will occur in the console, and no data will display.

Cities that have been previously searched will save in the browser's local storage. Any saved searches can be easily accessed again by clicking on the button with the city's name.

## Development

This application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. BootStrap was used to enhance CSS styling. Moment.js and jQuery were used to aid JavaScript functionality. This application also uses a server API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). This API provides the application with weather data.
